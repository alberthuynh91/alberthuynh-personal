Albert is also a very honest and empathic communicator who cares a lot about the work and how everyone on the team is doing. He is generous with feedback and encourages an open and trusting culture. Finally, he’s a sharp and intuitive engineer who is not afraid to tackle any part of the stack or dive into unfamiliar waters. I’d jump at the opportunity to work with him again."
